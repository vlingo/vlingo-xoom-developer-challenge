Date: 2021-04-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the project is a demo for vlingo-xoom-developer-challenge a more advanced Reactive DDD platform, it will be helpful to save all architectural decisions in one place.

## Decision

For all architectural decisions Architecture Decision Log (ADL) is created. All decisions will be recorded as Architecture Decision Records (ADR). 

Each ADR will be recorded using [Michael Nygard template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), which contains following sections: Status, Context, Decision and Consequences.

## Consequences

All architectural decisions should be recorded in log. Old decisions should be recorded as well with an approximate decision date. New decisions should be recorded on a regular basis.
